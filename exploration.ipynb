    "`The Zestimate® home valuation model is Zillow’s estimate of a home's market value. The Zestimate incorporates public and user-submitted data, taking into account home facts, location and market conditions.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`It is not an appraisal and it should be used as a starting point. We encourage buyers, sellers and homeowners to supplement the Zestimate with other research such as visiting the home, getting a professional appraisal of the home, or requesting a comparative market analysis (CMA) from a real estate agent.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`The amount of data we have for your home and homes in your area directly affects the Zestimate's accuracy. If the data is incorrect or incomplete, update your home facts — this may affect your Zestimate.`    \n",
    "    \n",
    "`The Zestimate was created to give consumers more information about homes and the housing market. It is intended to provide user-friendly data to promote transparent real estate markets and allow people to make more informed decisions — it should not be used to drive up the price of a home. Zestimates are designed to track the market, not drive it.`\n",
    "    \n",
    "`The Zestimate is not an appraisal and can't be used in place of an appraisal. It is a computer-generated estimate of the value of a home today, given the available data.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Note: The Zestimate's accuracy is computed by comparing the final sale price to the Zestimate that was published on or just prior to the sale date.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Median Error:\n",
    "    The nationwide median error rate for the Zestimate for on-market homes is 1.9%, while the Zestimate for off-market homes has a median error rate of 7.5%. This means that the Zestimates for half of all on-market homes are within 2% of the selling price, and half are not. For most major markets, the Zestimate for on-market homes is within 10% of the final sale price more than 95% of the time.`"
