A README that explains what the project is, how to reproduce you work, and your notes from project planning.

The goal of this stage is to clearly define your goal(s), measures of success, and plans on how to achieve that.

The goal of this project is to discover the drivers of Zillow's Zestimate logerror using single unit properties sold in May and June of 2017.




The deliverable is documentation of your goal, your measure of success, and how you plan on getting there. If you haven't clearly defined success, you will not know when you have achieved it.

How to get there: You can get there by answering questions about the final product & formulating or identifying any initial hypotheses (from you or others).

Common questions include:

    What will the end product look like?
    What format will it be in?
    Who will it be delivered to?
    How will it be used?
    How will I know I'm done?
    What is my MVP?
    How will I know it's good enough?

Formulating hypotheses

    Is attribute V1 related to attribute V2?
    Is the mean of target variable Y for subset A significantly different from that of subset B?
    ...
